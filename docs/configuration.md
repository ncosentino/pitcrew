# Configuration

`Setup-Runner.ps1` is the operator entry point. Each invocation converges one
profile without changing other profiles on the same host.

## Setup parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description | Default |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `-Token` | No | Fine-grained PAT used only to register runners. When omitted, PitCrew uses `gh auth token`. | Authenticated `gh` token |
| `-Profile` | No | Built-in profile name. | `default` |
| `-ProfilePath` | No | Path to an external profile manifest. Relative image-build paths resolve from the manifest directory. | None |
| `-Scope` | No | GitHub runner scope: `repo`, `org`, or `ent`. | `repo` |
| `-Repos` | Repository scope | Repository URLs, optionally followed by `=workers`. | None |
| `-AddRepos` | No | Adds repositories to the selected profile's generated state. | None |
| `-RemoveRepos` | No | Removes repositories from the selected profile's generated state. | None |
| `-OrgName` | Organization scope | GitHub organization name. | None |
| `-EnterpriseName` | Enterprise scope | GitHub enterprise name. | None |
| `-Replicas` | No | Default workers per repository, or total workers for organization/enterprise scope. `0` auto-sizes to half the host processors with a minimum of two. | Profile value |
| `-Labels` | No | Comma-separated custom labels. The mandatory profile label remains. | Profile value |
| `-NamePrefix` | No | Prefix shown for runner registrations in GitHub. | Host name plus profile |
| `-Image` | No | Overrides the profile's worker image. | Profile value |
| `-PullImage` | No | Controls whether setup pulls a prebuilt image before verification. | Profile value |
| `-RunnerGroup` | No | Organization or enterprise runner group. | Profile value |
| `-Down` | No | Stops only the selected profile and removes its managed workers. | Off |

## Repository worker counts

Repository scope supports a different count for every target:

```powershell
.\Setup-Runner.ps1 -Repos `
    https://github.com/you/light-project=1,`
    https://github.com/you/heavy-project=6
```

These workers are dedicated to their repositories. Use organization or
enterprise scope when several repositories should share one capacity pool.

## Profile manifest

Named profiles conform to
[`runner-profile.schema.json`](https://github.com/ncosentino/pitcrew/blob/main/runner-profile.schema.json).

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `schemaVersion` | Yes | Manifest contract version. Version `1` is currently supported. |
| `name` | Yes | Lowercase profile identifier and mandatory routing label. |
| `description` | Yes | Human-readable purpose. |
| `image` | Yes | Worker image tag. |
| `labels` | Yes | Additional capability labels. |
| `replicas` | Yes | Default positive worker count. |
| `pullImage` | No | Pull a prebuilt image before verification. |
| `disableDefaultLabels` | No | Omit GitHub's broad default labels. Named profiles default to `true`. |
| `runnerGroup` | No | Organization or enterprise runner group. |
| `verificationCommands` | No | Shell commands executed in the prepared image before profile replacement. |
| `build` | No | Local Docker build context, Dockerfile, and non-secret build arguments. |

## Generated state

The default profile writes `.env`; named profiles write `.env.<profile>`.
PitCrew generates these files and Git ignores them because they contain the
runner-registration token. Do not edit or commit them.
